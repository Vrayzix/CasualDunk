# Introduction

Casual Dank is a 3D casual game where you play basketball.

Your goal in this game is to score goals until you win.

I implemented different features: Player Controller Script, UI interfaces, Sound Effects, Particle Effects,...

# Game Mechanics:


The game mechanics are pretty simple: you have a basketball and need to throw it at the basket to score a goal, and there is an energy bar that shows you how much force you are adding to your throw.

There is a score mechanic that detects if you scored a goal which will increase it, but if you don't score a goal and the ball falls in the ground, it is decreased.
Every time you score a goal, the player's distance with the basket becomes bigger which makes the game more challenging.

# User Interface:


I implemented a simple UI for the game, to make the navigation for the player run smoothly, there is also an option to enable and disable music and sound effects.

Having a good UI is important for the player to have an enjoyable experience while playing your game.

# Conclusion:
Currently, I like the state of the game, but there are still many new contents I will add in the future.
